# Sorting-suite  

## Objectives
 * The goal of this project is to write 4 sorting algorithms and test them.  The algorithms are: bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.  The algorithms can be loosely compared using mocha testing. The test times out after 2 seconds, and displays the length of time to return the sorted array. This allows us to find the upper limits of array size and speed of sorting for the array being sorted.

 ## Algorithms

 ### Bubble Sort
  * Using two nested for loops, this algorithm will start at the beginning of the array and sequentially compare neighboring values. The
